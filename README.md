# TrelloUX Update

This is a Chrome extension designed to give Trello a more up-to-date user experience, to reduce clutter and increase scanability, especially for power users.

I haven't regression tested this extension for all situations - it works well for my use cases, if you need something fixed feel free to contribue :) 

## Features and usage:

### Simplified label colours
- If you mainly use one label per card, TrelloUX now shows the label colour as a stripe down the left of the card
- This greatly reduces screen clutter especially if you have lots of cards
- Turn this off and show all labels by clicking the toggle button "Labels: Hide/Show"

### Collapsible lists
- You can now collapse lists using the arrow at the top of each list
- Collapsed lists are maintained between sessions

### Tags in card titles
- Using @Tags in card titles now bolds those tags, useful for e.g. @Mentions
- Using #Tags in card titles now italics those tags
- Using !Tags in card titles 

### Line breaks in card titles
- Use /n in a card title to add a line-break. Add as many breaks as you like :)

### Separator cards
- Use --- in a card title to create a separator card

## Goals of this project
1. Only elegant solutions
2. Fast
